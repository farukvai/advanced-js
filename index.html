You’re terrified, though, that your combined efforts won’t be enough to get your dresser up the stairs and into the bedroom…</p>
		<p>Or maybe you’ve found a charming house in the suburbs where you can finally start your family. It’d take quite a few trips in your SUV and your husband’s sedan, though, to deliver even a fraction of your things from your old apartment to your new home…</p>

		<p>We are dedicated to making the moving process simple (and even pleasant!) for our commercial clients by providing our signature “White Glove” services–that is, doing everything we can to make the moving process easy and stress-free by rolling out the red carpet and providing the service an A-list celebrity would expect.</p>
		<p>Our white glove service capitalizes on open communication that keeps you informed on how your move is progressing and allows for you to freely contact us with any questions or concerns; professional and courteous service from our highly-trained and vetted staff (never outside contractors); efficient and safe packing that ensures items remain undamaged; on-time delivery that you can count on; and total honesty in pricing that lets you easily compare us to our competitors.

		<p>Relocating from or to an apartment or condo can require a little more care than moving in or out of a home. With a safety deposit at stake, extra care is needed to ensure your move doesn’t damage walls, doors, or floors. Navigating stairs and narrow hallways can be a headache, too, as you wonder how you got your bed frame into your apartment in the first place. Last of all, you’ll have a strict schedule to adhere to if you want to avoid all hassle with your building management!</p>
		<p>We’re dedicated to helping our clients move without any loss or damage to either their items or their living spaces. That’s why we offer our comprehensive packing services. We respect your items and your money and do what’s necessary to prepare your furniture, kitchen supplies, and other items for a safe move–whether that means boxing, wrapping, or securing items.</p>
		<p>Many apartments and condos lay at the end of a hallway or up a set of stairs. If you’re worried about getting your couch up and down the stairs, we’re ready to help. We’ll move all your bulky, heavy furniture for you, from bed frames to recliners. Moving is a challenge enough; let us do the heavy lifting for you–and then deliver them to your new home.</p>
		<p>Time is of the essence when you’ve told your management company that you intend to leave. We’re dedicated to promptness and punctuality in all steps of the moving process, so we can help you get out of your old unit and into your new one swiftly and avoid any extra fees.</p>

		<p>Although so many of our services revolve around helping you move from one place to another, we know that life calls for many types of change—and occasionally smaller actions are called for. Sometimes, the move you have planned is just of the furniture inside your living room.</p>
		<p>You could spend all day clearing the shelves of your bookcases, dragging your sofa across the wood floors, lifting the side tables and walking them to their new locations–and end up exhausted, sore, and still needing to tweak and turn your chairs and lamps to fit just right.</p>
		<p>You could, in other words, spend all day on what feels as if it should have been a simple task–and then need a couple of aspirin, an ice pack, and a chiropractic visit to recuperate fully.</p>
		<p>Or you could call in Stella Moving & Delivery’s expert team of movers and get the job done quickly, effortlessly, and with absolutely no discomfort.</p>
		<p>If you need a hand with rearranging your couches and bookshelves, switching your children's bedrooms, or any other <a href="/internal-moving-services-san-diego/">internal moves</a>, Stella Moving & Delivery has you covered. No job is too small--so don't strain your back dragging your love seat or sprain your ankle tripping over the coffee table. We'd be happy to help you move all your items, bulky or small, at a fair price.</p>
